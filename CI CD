The files you need to deploy an app on Binder depend on the type of app you're deploying:

**For a Streamlit App:**

1. **Your Streamlit Script:**  This is the main Python file containing your Streamlit code (e.g., `main.py`, `app.py`).
2. **Optional: requirements.txt:**  This file lists all the Python libraries your app needs to run. Binder will install these libraries automatically during the build process. 

**For a Voila App:**

1. **Your Jupyter Notebook:** This is the notebook containing your code and visualizations (e.g., `my_notebook.ipynb`).
2. **Optional: requirements.txt:**  Similar to Streamlit apps.

**Additionally:**

* **Optional: README.md:** This file provides instructions and context about your app.

**Important Note:**

While Binder can directly launch Jupyter notebooks, deploying a Streamlit app requires a slightly different approach. Here are two common methods:

1. **Using a custom launch script:** You can create a script (e.g., `.binder/postBuild`) that launches your Streamlit app using the `streamlit run` command. 

2. **Using a dedicated repository:** Some community repositories showcase how to configure Binder for Streamlit apps. You can fork these repositories and customize them for your specific needs (e.g., [https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/streamlit-app-and-binder/9487](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/streamlit-app-and-binder/9487) by chekos).

**In summary:**

* The core file depends on your app type (Streamlit script or Jupyter notebook).
* A `requirements.txt` file is helpful for listing dependencies.
* Readme and custom launch scripts might be necessary depending on your chosen deployment method.
